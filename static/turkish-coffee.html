        <p>I recreate this page on ibrik coffee that used to exists on
          this website with the url <code>turkish-coffee.html</code> on the
          same url for letting it to be accessed via old
          bookmarks. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203052438/http://gkayaalp.com/turkish-coffee.html">Here</a>
          is an Internet Archive link to that original page. I choose to
          call it ibrik coffe for detaching it from nations and proposing it
          as a generic recipe where the main distinctive quality is the
          medium, i.e. ibrik.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>You can skip to <a href="#recipes">recipes</a>. Though this
        introduction is essential reading if you visit this page for the
        fist time!</p>
      <p>Ibrik coffee, a.k.a: arabic/armenian/greek/turkish coffee, is a
        method of coffee&#45;brewing invented and rather popular in the
        middle east and balkans that has been in use in households and
        coffee&#45;houses for centuries to this day.</p>
      <p>At its heart, it is a very simple brewing method where
        powder&#45;fine coffee grains are immersed in water that&#8217;s
        contained in a <em>ibrik</em>, a.k.a <em>cezve</em> &#8211; a metal
        container wider at the bottom with a handle attached close to the
        rim &#8211; and heated until the natural foam forms on the top and
        rises. But there&#8217;s some variety around this basic recipe,
        where small deviations result in different tastes and properties in
        the end product.</p>
      <p>First, it&#8217;s possible to brew ibrik with milk instead of
        water. A distinct type of milk coffee, it has its unique
        flavour. Then, many spices may be added, where, traditionally the
        most popular ones are: cardamom, mastic and cinnamon.</p>
      <p>The sugar may or may not be added, and while it obviously affects
        the sweetness of the coffee, it also affects the body and the
        foam. With sugar, the coffee will have more body to it, and the foam
        will be more and denser.</p>
      <p>Any type of coffee beans and any roast can be used for preparing
        ibrik coffee, but a medium&#45;to&#45;dark roast beans with mild
        flavors are more fit. Fruity or citrusy aromas may get excessively
        amplified, resulting in a sour cup. The key is the grind, the coffee
        beans should be ground to a very fine powder, finer even than
        espresso, at least as fine as powdered sugar. Bigger grinds will
        float in the cup instead of sinking to the bottom.</p>
      <p>The coffee may be put into cold or hot water. When put into cold
        water, the ibrik containing the mixture is placed on heat and the
        mixture is mixed either in the beginning or halfway throught the
        brewing process, or continuously. When let to bloom a bit before
        mixing, a better foam may be achieved. When mixed initially and left
        to raise, the body will be denser. For densest body, mix all along
        while brewing. When coffee&#8217;s put into just&#45;boiled water,
        left to rest for about a minute and mixed and put on heat, the
        resulting coffee will have less body to it, and a lighter
        taste. Sugar may be added while heating the water, before adding
        coffee, then it&#8217;ll get caramelised and give a slightly
        different taste.</p>
      <p>The usual serving for the ibrik coffee is the demitasse. The
        demitasse is used also for measuring, where about one heaped
        teaspoonful of coffee (5&#45;7 grammes) per demitasse (roughly 60ml)
        is used. I&#8217;ll use the term <em>cup</em> to mean demitasse,
        interchangably, throughout this text. Lots of different cups have
        been used with ibrik coffee, of varying sizes, shapes and designs
        throughout history, each belonging to different cultures, social
        classes, places and
        ambiences. <a href="http://en.peramuzesi.org.tr/Exhibition/Coffee-Break/161">A
          collection of authentic ottoman ceramic coffee cups</a> is exhibited
        at the <a href="http://en.peramuzesi.org.tr/Visit/7">Pera Museum</a>
        of Istanbul. A serving usually accompanied by a glass of water, and
        sometimes by some candy (e.g. turkish delight).</p>
      <p>After brewing, the coffee is poured directly into the cups, where
        the foam is either distributed via a teaspoon, or poured in
        simultaneously with the drink. The grounds are not filtered, but
        being very fine, they immediately sink to the bottom of the
        cup. Sometimes the last sip has some grounds in it, if accidentally
        drunk, the palate is cleaned with some water.</p>
      <p>The turkish word for breakfast is <em>kahvaltı</em>,
        meaning <em>meal before coffee</em>. Ibrik coffee has lots of
        tradition around it determining how, when, and by whom it is drunk
        at certain occasions. In Turkey, where I&#8217;m from, one very
        iconic tradition is the coffee serving at the <em>kız isteme</em>
        ceremony, a preconiugal occasion where families of the
        soon&#45;to&#45;be spouses meet, and the parents of the
        husband&#45;to&#45;be ask for permission to the parents of the
        wife&#45;to&#45;be for the marriage, at the brides house. The
        potential bride is required to serve the coffee to her family and
        their guests. Traditionally, the potential husbands coffee is served
        salty, a joke as old as the hills. Another tradition around ibrik
        coffee is <em>tasseomancy</em>, where the patterns formed by coffee
        grounds that sink to the bottom of the cup after the coffee is
        consumed are interpreted to tell the fortune of the drinker. When
        the drink finishes, the cup is covered with the saucer, flipped
        upside down, usually moved in a horizontal circle a couple times
        (where in Turkey the phrase <em>«neyse hâlim, çıksın fâlim»</em> is
        pronounced, meaning «how are my matters, my fortune shall tell») and
        left to cool. When the bottom of the cup is cool to touch, the
        shapes that form in the cup and on the saucer after it&#8217;s
        slightly inclined are interpreted. Coffee is also served after
        meals, and to guests on their visits to houses and offices.</p>
      <p>One particular aspect of ibrik coffee preparation is to ask the
        requested amount of sugar beforehand. Because the grounds are
        included in the final beverage, sugar is added while brewing, not
        after. Thus, whoever offers coffee asks beforehand to his or her
        guests how much if any sugar they want in their coffee. In Turkey,
        the question is either the formal phrase <em>«kahveniz nasıl
          olsun?»</em> or the more informal <em>«kaç şeker?»</em>, where the
        usual responses are one of <em>sâde/acı, az, orta, şekerli</em>; no
        sugar, little sugar, mild, sugary, respectively.</p>
      <p>The consummation of a cup of ibrik coffee has its own peculiar
        way: some water is drunk beforehand, then the coffee is sipped
        slowly before it cools down, though never rushed.</p>
      <h1 id="recipes">Recipes</h1>
      <p>All recipes are for a single serving.</p>
      <p>Any additional spices are added when coffee is added.</p>
      <h1 id="from-cold-water-mix-initially">From cold water, mix
        initially</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a teaspoonful of coffee and a cup of water into the ibrik,
          add the desired amount of sugar, mix well now, or mix continuously
          on heat.</li>
        <li>Place on low heat for about two or three minutes.</li>
        <li>Take off and pour when the foam forms and raises, but before
          the coffee boils.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 id="from-cold-water-late-mix">From cold water, late mix</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a teaspoonful of coffee and a cup of water into the ibrik,
          add the desired amount of sugar.</li>
        <li>Place on low heat for about two or three minutes.</li>
        <li>About a minute after placing the ibrik on heat, mix well.</li>
        <li>Take off and pour when the foam forms and raises, but before
          the coffee boils.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 id="from-hot-water">From hot water</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a cup of water and the desired amount sugar into the
          ibrik.</li>
        <li>Heat to a soft boil, take off, rest a couple seconds.</li>
        <li>Add half a teaspoonful of coffee, let bloom, either mix now or
          after blooming.</li>
        <li>Place ibrik on low heat.</li>
        <li>Take off and pour when the foam forms and raises, but before
          the coffee boils.</li>
      </ol>
      <h1 id="milky">Milky</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a cup of milk and half a teaspoonful of coffee, and the
          desired amount of sugar.</li>
        <li>Put on low heat, mix slowly all along.</li>
        <li>Take off and pour when the foam forms and raises, but before
          the coffee boils.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When making multiple cups in one ibrik, duplicate the
        measurements, then add a bit more coffee to taste to maintain the
        desired strenght for each cup.</p>
      <p>In order to evenly distribute the foam without the spoon, fill
        each cup half way first, and then fill up the cups starting from the
        last one that was filled half way. First time round, incline the
        cups by about 45 degrees and pour slowly. It&#8217;s okay to shake
        the ibrik gently to bring the foam closer to the pouring edge. But
        for fairly sharing foam, use a spoon to distribute first, then pour
        the rest of coffee gently into the cups.</p>
      <p>Never ever boil the coffee. But it&#8217;s okay to take from heat
        while raising, and put it back on a short while after to raise
        multiple times. This way the taste and the foam may be
        controlled.</p>
      <p>The ibriks come in many types and sizes. For nice foam and best
        taste, always use the smallest ibrik possible for your servings,
        though mind the gap for the foam to raise. To keep foam as dense as
        possible while raising, use an ibrik that&#8217;s wider at the
        bottom, and gradually narrows towars the top. I use copper ibriks
        from the famous ibrik and grinder
        producer <a href="http://www.tarihidegirmencisozen.com/">Sözen</a>,
        whose products can be found on Amazon. They also have
        a <a href="http://www.tarihidegirmencisozen.com/iletisim">nice
          little shop</a>
        (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sar%C4%B1demir,+Tarihi+De%C4%9Firmenci+S%C3%B6zen,+Kantarc%C4%B1lar+Cd.+No:53,+34134+Fatih%2F%C4%B0stanbul,+Turkey/@41.0184175,28.9662651,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14cab9ed0a339573:0x85da08a76eefcf6b">map</a>)
        in Eminönü, İstanbul. I use one of their brass hand grinders too. If
        you&#8217;re going to buy one, don&#8217;t buy the small ones which
        are about 10 cm tall, buy a bigger one. The small ones are hard to
        operate because of their size. Hario hand grinders won&#8217;t
        work.</p>
      <p>There are pre&#45;ground and pre&#45;flavoured coffee for
        ibriks. In Turkey the most popular one by far
        is <a href="http://www.mehmetefendi.com/">Kurukahveci Mehmet
          Efendi</a>. Their <a href="http://www.mehmetefendi.com/eng/pages/i.html">shop
          at Eminönü</a>
        (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tahtakale+Mh.,+Kurukahveci+Mehmet+Efendi,+TAHM%C4%B0S+SOKAK+No:66,+34116+Fatih%2F%C4%B0stanbul,+Turkey/@41.0165434,28.9702545,19z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x14cab9bd686aff7b:0x4ec9cb125d340f8d">map</a>)
        is a tourist destination where people line up for freshly ground
        coffee, though it&#8217;s the same thing they sell in the
        supermarket.</p>
      <p>I&#8217;m from Istanbul, so I know what&#8217;s good here. There
        certainly are local artisans everywhere this drink is enjoyed.</p>
      <p>Experimenting is the key, be adventurous with your method,
        personalise. The best way is the way you like the most. Still,
        abundant foam is a sign of expertise.</p>
      <p><strong>Never</strong> let your ibrik alone. Things happen
        quickly, and if you don&#8217;t take it off the heat when the coffee
        raises as high as the rim, it won&#8217;t hesitate to go over and
        make a mess.</p>
