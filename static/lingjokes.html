	    <p>Noticing a distinct lack of tasteless linguistics jokes on
	    the internet that are not
	    <a href="https://reddit.com/r/BadLinguistics">
		r/BadLinguistics</a> material, I took it upon myself to
	    collect here a bunch of groaners that will torture your soul
	    and get my website in your /etc/hosts blocklists.  Hate me
	    all you want, my appreciation of bad jokes and terrible puns
	    will not be affected.</p>
	    <p>Don't take these beautiful abominations personally; they
	    are meant to be funny, not factual.</p>

	    <h2>a few originals</h2>

	    <p>A linguist walked in to a bar. "The usual," they
	    murmurred. The bartender apologised: "I am new here, sir..."
	    The linguist raised their head, and noticed that they didn't
	    know the bartender indeed. "Sorry," they asked, "is this not
	    The Inn Bar?" The bartender smiled: "No, sir, you must have
	    climbed the stairs in a rush, this is The Inn Pub."</p>

	    <p>What does a lumberjack and a syntactician have in
	    common?—Both abuse trees for a living.</p>

	    <p>What do you call a pack of linguists that don't like
	    generative grammar? —A linguist-i-con.</p>

	    <p>Why didn't the psycholinguist cross the road?—The car
	    stopped by the cops yelled.</p>

	    <p>OK so if you are not a linguist, you probably don't
	    understand what these jokes are about. If you <i>are</i>
	    a linguist, you're mad at me because none of the jokes
	    characterise observed facts accurately. That's linguistics
	    in a nutshell...</p>

	    <p>What is the cause of widespread orgasmic dysfunction among
	    linguists? Poverty of stimulus.</p>

	    <p>If you have two phones that you use interchangeably, you
	    have two allophones.</p>

	    <p>If you have two phones that you use interchangeably, you
	    have a phoneme.</p>

	    <p>If two allophones are very flattering to each other, they
	    are in complimentary distribution.</p>

	    <h2>stuff I stole</h2>

	    <p>A subject walks into a bar and sits down in a little vP.
	    Guy comes out of the bathroom and tells the subject "Hey
	    buddy, get up! That's my seat!" Subject says, "Oh, yeah?
	    Well, you'll have to get me to agree to move."</p>

	    <p>Variable walks into a bar, only to have the owner shout,
	    "Hey, we're existentially closed, so you're bound to be here
	    for the night!"</p>

	    <p>So, this Maximal Projection walks into a V-bar, and says:
	    “Give me a little vP!”<br/>
	    The bartender asks: “Really? That’s not your usual
	    order.”<br/>
	    And the Maximal Projection replies: “I know ... maybe it’s
	    just a phase.”
