This page is a list of links for my publicly available software projects
and adjacent stuff. Follow the links for more information.

# Emacs Lisp

I have a bunch of public Emacs programs, extensions, and input methods,
available from my [Emacs Lisp repo on GitHub][src-elisp].

# Dotfiles

My [dotfiles repo][dotfiles] contains the user and OS configurations for
my computing setups, along with my Emacs configuration and a bunch of
shell, Perl, Python and Ruby scripts.

# Abandoned

## Pomodorino

[Pomodorino](./pomodorino.html) was a simple, work-in-slow-progress
pomodoro timer (currently) built with Python and PyGObject.

I abandoned this project as I found the Pomodoro technique didn’t help
me all that much and I didn’t need the app anymore.

The source code is archived on Github.

## Gemini scripts

I have a few scripts for the [Gemini protocol][gemini] available on my
[gemini-scripts repo][src-gemini].

I tried Gemini briefly and didn’t grow to like it much so the scripts
repo is on Github and archived.
