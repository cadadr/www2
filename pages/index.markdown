I am <abbr title="/gÅ“k.'tuË‘/">GÃ¶ktuÄŸ</abbr>
<small>(<abbr title="English pronouns.">they/he</abbr>)</small>,
I also go by [cadadr] on the internet.

Iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student in [linguistics at Hacettepe University][idb],
currently working on my thesis.

I speak Turkish, English, and Italian; and [enjoy messing around with
computers][gh] when I find the time.

[^1]: I donâ€™t really use Twitter.
[^2]: I used to have a blog here, but itâ€™s sadly fallen victim to a
  shell scripting accidentÂ ðŸ•¯.  Here are a couple salvaged pages:
  [Â«linguistics preprintsÂ»](./lingpreprints.html); [Â«what is
  programming anywaysÂ»](./what_is_prog.html); and [my ibrik (turkish)
  coffee recipes](./turkish-coffee.html).
