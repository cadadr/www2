Pomodorino is a lightweight, simple Pomodoro timer system tray
application written using Python 3 and GTK 3.

What sets it apart is that it’s totally FOSS (licensed under GPLv3+)
and really lightweight. Alternative Linux apps that I could find were
either paid and proprietrary or they used rather heavy technologies
like Electron.

Using Pomodorino should be rather straight-forward if you know about
the [Pomodoro Technique®][pomodorotm] (which is a registered trademark
of Francesco Cirillo).
