# Meaning of «kütüptiyini»

_(Or often appearing as ‘kutuptiyini’ due to the unnecessary
limitations of many computing systems…)_

This is a Turkish word I made up; combing _kütüp-_, a truncation of
_kütüphane_ meaning “library”, and _tiyin_, a dialectal Turkish word
for “squirrel”. The trailing _-i_ is a suffix morpheme which in this
case marks the noun-complement of a noun phrase with a noun head. In
simpler terms, it translate to “library squirrel, squirrel of
library”.

I first came up with this as a turkish translation of “library
squirrel”, which I used as a username on [fediverse] for a while. It
references my favourite animal, the squirrel, and my favourite place,
the library. Also it is a reference to the “squirrel brain” stereotype
about ADHD, which I highly suspect I have.
