# Privileged and/or majoritised identity discourses

Discourse is a major, arguably the main component of building identities, and
putting them to work. This work includes everything from pure self expression
to gentrification to struggles for rights and justice. Whether by means of
words, symbols, or actions, communication is at the centre of these pursuits.

This is just as true for majoritised, privileged people, as it is for
marginalised members of society. Yet, scholarship has, until recently,
almost exclusively focused on the latter. With most scholars, even still, being
majoritised &/ privileged persons, with the origins and tendencies of social
sciences and humanities to reflect the scrutinising, pathologising gaze of
majorities and of privileged castes of societies, and with the way academia and
research is, this outcome is hardly surprising.

The study of privileged &/ majoritised identities is meant to turn the tables
on the more comfortable, more powerful individuals and groups of society.  It
is a research agenda that I have created for myself, in light of, with
inspiration from, and in solidarity with a nascent trend of studying those
people who represent, wield, preserve, and benefit from power, high status,
economic advantages, and _unmarkedness_; because, it is these castes, and these
advantaged---and usually powerful, in one way or another---individuals and
groups, that _marginalise_ their various outgroups, and create inequality and
injustice in our societies.

By means of the study of their identities---which is a core component of how
they preserve and operationalise their power and advantages---, by demystifying
and analysing the discourses through which they accomplish _identity work_, and
[affect the world](./rsc-ids.html), we can locate the causes of inequalities
and injustices in our societies, as well as learning about how _marginalising
processes_ function, and demystifying the discursive mechanisms through which
advantage and power are derived. This information then, I believe, can be
a useful tool in dismantling those very inequalities and injustices, through
aiding in the disruption of those very processes and discourses.
