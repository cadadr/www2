- [Ankara'dan Bir Kuş Uçtu](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2cAJ8Pxk71dDsNC5b8dqNb)
  which contains music relating to the city of Ankara, of a multitude
  of genres;

- [Lusitânia](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3DCBxnvlTU8IcpsQHnbzaF),
  for music from Portugal (a playlist which I had created to help me
  with learning European Portuguese, as back in the Dark Ages, I
  wished to become a researcher in Portuguese literature, focusing on
  Pessoa and Saramago).
