    "comment": "[PubPeer](https://pubpeer.com/) is a moderated post-publication review\nplatform where academic journal publications can be discussed outside\nthe [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) process.\n\nPeer review is highly regarded, but like many other highly regarded\nstuff in academia, is deeply problematic in multiple ways. Publications\nin and of themselves are highly problematic, and PubPeer thus can only\nbe effective after something manages to go thru that biased and flawed\nfilter, but still, I like a grassroots effort like this.\n\nThis Zotero extension displays any existing PubPeer comments for stuff that's in your Zotero database.",

    "comment": "The comment in the links is a response to [this one](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30559783) which is the usual «piracy gone too far» response, as above, to a submission about a browser extension that can bypass paywalls (and that's what it's transparently called). The reply is cool in that it points out how we **always** had some way of reading the all the news for free.\n\nThis is indeed a major problem with subscriptions and DRM'ed media, i.e. they are only accessible so long as you pay, and only to people those who pay. But we always had the papers and magazines in the waiting rooms, and we always had, even before the commoditised papers and books, the library.\n",
