The reply is cool in that it points out how we **always** had some way of reading the all the news for free.\n\nThis is indeed a major problem with subscriptions and DRM'ed media, i.e. they are only accessible so long as you pay, and only to people those who pay. But we always have the papers and magazines in the waiting rooms, and we always had, even before the commoditised papers and books, the library.\n",
